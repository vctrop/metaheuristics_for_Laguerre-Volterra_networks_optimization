# Metaheuristics in the optimization of Laguerre-Volterra networks

The Laguerre-Volterra network (LVN) is a Volterra-equivalent connectionist architecture, which combines a bank of discrete Laguerre filters and a layer of polynomial activation functions.
This architecture is designed to model nonlinear dynamic systems from input-output signals.

Here we optimize the continuous parameters of the LVN to model synthetic systems using different metaheuristics, with the purpose of performance evaluation.

To use a faster implementation with more metaheuristics, switch to the 'master' branch.

## Scripts and their uses
* generate_datasets.py          - Uses the data_handling module to generate synthetic train and test IO signals from simulated systems.
* optimize_LVN.py               - Optimizes LVNs with arbitrary structure using different metaheuristics (mostly used for verification)
* results_collection.py         - Runs some specified metaheuristic 30 times and stores the solutions found, along with their errors on test signals
* results_stats.py              - With the results from 'results_collection.py', compute averages and standard deviations for train and test errors
* results_stats_significance.py - Compute the statistical significance of the results with the Friedman and Nemenyi tests
* plotting scripts
